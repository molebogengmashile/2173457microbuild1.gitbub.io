        <p>
            This is a game of snake. The snake (you) has to collect as many apples as possible to earn points whilst avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself (obsticles).<br>
            The red apples gets you one point and the green apples get you two points, however the you lose a piece of snake<br>
            and that lost snake part becomes another obsticle you have to avoid. The goal of the snake is to collect apples to store. You can store apples when you have <br>
            collected atleast ten of them. If you have collided with an obsticle, you can restart the game with the collect apples button, however, the obsticles and apples from the previous round still remain.<br>
            Use arrow keys to play.<br>
            Good luck!
